                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>
In March 2012, Ryosuke Watanabe, sushi chef at Inakaya for 14 years, became the new owner of this St. Andrews
location and re-named it Inakaya Watanabe.
In Japan, the Watanabe family was known in their region of Yamagata for the special sukiyaki dinners they served at their
bed and breakfast. Ryo wants for his guests to enjoy Japanese cuisine the way he and his family know and enjoy it which
means building on Inakaya’s traditional foundation. He has made a commitment to stay true to the same style of cooking,
types of dishes, and quality of ingredients as he uses at home. As one who truly enjoys indulging in the freshest, the most
                    authentic, and the most unique sushi, Ryo vows to have the largest selection of the freshest fish.
